<h2>Configuration Steps</h2>

<p>
This tutorial picks up where we left off in the previous section where we created a Windows 10 Virtual Machine in Azure and followed all the prerequisit and installation steps for osTicket. We will be creating Roles, Departments, Teams, Agents, Users, SLAs and Help Topics in our osTicket system.
</p>

<p>
In order to access osTicket as an administrator, browse to the following URL: http://localhost/osTicket/scp/index.php
</p>
<p>
You will be prompted to enter a Username and Password. These are the values we entered during the initial osTicket Installation setup.
</p>
<br />

<p>
Once you've entered your credentials, you should see the index page. 
</p>

</p>

<p>
At the top of the Dashboard you can toggle between Admin Panel and User Panel. In this case we'll be setting up the Ticket System as an Admin.
</p>
<br />

<p>
- Roles:
</p>

<p>
The first thing we'll create is a Role with access to all the features in the ticketing system, that is, a role that can basically do anything in the system. We'll name this role "Supreme Admin."
</p>

<p>
On the Agents tab → Roles → Add New Role.
</p>


<p>

</p>

<p>
Now, let's assign permissions to this new role we have created. And, remember, we want this Admin to be able to have "full control" of the Ticketing System. 
</p>
<p>
On the Permission tabs, under Tickets, check all options.
</p>

</p>


<p>
Under the Tasks and Knowledgebase tabs, check all options as well.
</p>

</p>
<br />


<p>
- Departments:
</p>

<p>
Let's create a New Department named "System Administrators." Agents tab → Departments → Add New Department
</p>


<p>
<img src="https://github.com/mariamcpherson/os_ticket_postinstall/assets/139581822/4dc6e080-5f50-4397-986c-b4b38920dbb1"/>
</p>
<br />

<p>
- Teams:
</p>

<p>
Now, let's create a team. This would allow us to assign different agents to that particular team with different accesses and permissions to different features, and to assign tickets to a whole team. 
</p>
<p>
In this tutorial, I created a team named "Level II Support." Agents tab → Teams → Add New Team
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/mariamcpherson/os_ticket_postinstall/assets/139581822/ee9996f7-83a4-4801-b16e-95aec8550795"/>
</p>
<br />


<p>
*Before we proceed to create Agents, we need to determine who can create new tickets in our system, for the sake of this tutorial, we'll allow anyone to create tickets with registration required.
</p>

<p>
Settings → Users → Authentication → Settings
</p>
<p>
We will check "Require registration and login to create tickets", and select "Public Access"
</p>

</p>
<br />


<p>
- Agents:
</p>

<p>
Next, we will be creating Agents that will work under a specific Department/Team. I used made up names and random values as with the rest of the tutorial. 
</p>

<p>
Agents → Add New Agents
</p>


<p>

</p>

<p>
Click on "Set Password" in order to assign credentials to the agent. 
</p>

</p>


<p>
On the Access tab, you can assign the Primary Department each Agent will be under, and the type of access.
</p>

<p>

</p>
<br />


<p>
- Configure Service Level Agreement (SLA):
</p>

<p>
In this section, different types of SLAs can be configured, according to the severity of the issue for which the ticket was created, and the target time in which the Help Desk Administrator expects them to be resolved.
</p>

<p>
Manage → SLA → Add New SLA 
</p>

<p>
In this tutorial, we will create 3 different types of SLAs for three different levels of severity:
</p>
<p>
Severity A SLA. This would correspond to tickets created for urgent or severe issues that would significantly impact the end user's business. For this reason the schedule to resolve tickets within this SLA would be 24/7, and the grace period would be only 1 hour. 
</p>

<p>

</p>


<p>
Severity B SLA. This would correspond to tickets created for less urgent tickets and the Administrator expects to be worked on around the clock, but with a longer grace period of 4 hours.
</p>

<p>

</p>


<p>
Severity C SLA. This level would correspond to non-urgent tickets that are expected to be resolved during normal business hours with a grace period of 8 hours.
</p>

<p>

</p>
<br />

<p>
- Help Desk Topics:
</p>

<p>
Next, we will create a few common categories of issues that may come up in the day-to-day operations of a Help Desk, as a manner of example. For the purposes of this tutorial, these categories are not meant to be a complete or exhaustive list of all possible issues that may be encountered as a Help Desk professional. I have created the following categories of Help Topics:
</p>
<p>
Business Critical Outage
Personal Computer Issues
Equipment Request
Password Reset
</p>

<p>
 Manage → Help Topics → Add New Topic 
</p>

<p>

</p>
<br />

<p>
- End Users: 
</p>

<p>
These can be created from the Agent Panel, and are the end users or customers who will be serviced by the Help Desk for which we are creating the Ticket System. You can create as many as needed. I have created just a couple of made up users for the purposes of this tutorial. 
</p>

<p>
 On the Agent Panel, go to Users → Add New User
</p>
